# Customer-Churn-Model-Assessment-ML-

The telecommunications (telecom) sector is experiencing rapid changes, witnessing the emergence of numerous telecom businesses and frequent shifts among customers from one provider to another. The term "churn" denotes the phenomenon where customers or subscribers discontinue their utilization of a company's services or products.

Understanding the factors influencing customer retention and predicting churn plays a pivotal role for telecom companies in elevating their service standards and bolstering customer satisfaction.

In this examination, the dynamics of customer behavior and demographics are analyzed to predict customer churn. This analysis makes use of two extensive datasets sourced from four major telecom partners: Airtel, Reliance Jio, Vodafone, and BSNL:

- The telecom_demographics.csv file contains information related to Indian customer demographics.

- The telecom_usage.csv file contains data on the usage patterns of Indian customers.


The goal is to build models for forecasting customer churn using Machine Learning. Specifically, Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier models will be trained, with an evaluation to determine which model yields a higher accuracy score in predicting telecom churn.
